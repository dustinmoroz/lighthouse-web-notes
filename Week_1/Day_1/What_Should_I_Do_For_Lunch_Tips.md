## Tips

try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in your terminal.

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```

### Important things to know!!!


- L.S.D. Logic / Syntax / Data

There are 2 different data types

  - **Primitive:** These data types never change (strings, booleans, etc)

  - **Non-primitave (Mutable):** Some aspects may change, but does not change the entire body of data. For example:

  _A car owner buys a car. The car is black, but the owner wants it to be red. The shop will paint the car red, but the car stays the same. The red colour, is a mutable data type._
